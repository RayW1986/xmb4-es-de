# XMB4 for EmulationStation Desktop Edition (ES-DE)

An XMB inspired theme for EmulationStation Desktop Edition. This theme is heavily inspired by the XMB user interface from the PlayStation 4.
This theme uses some assets from [ARTFLIX (REVISITED)](https://github.com/TheGrizzMD/artflix-revisited-es-de) by [TheGrizzMD](https://github.com/TheGrizzMD).

## **Configuration Options**

- The theme has a simple set of options that can be changed directly from the UI Settings menu of ES-DE
- `Theme Variant` - sets the layout used for the gamelist view when media & metadata are scraped for your games.  There are 6 variants to choose from:
   - `Composite Marquee` - Uses the marquee of the game in the carousel, with a fanart or screenshot composite.
   - `Cropped Cover Marquee` - Uses the boxart of the game, cropped to the square of the carousel.
   - `Simple Gamelist` - Uses a gamelist with a simple, less busy UI design.
- Each of the above variants have an animated background variant, also.
